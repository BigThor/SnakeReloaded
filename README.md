## Game mechanics
* Player is constantly moving in the direction that is facing.
* Player can change direction either with keyboard or controller.
* Player can go through the edge of the play area to appear on the other side.
* Player will die if they collide either with himself or an obstacle.
* Food spawns at a set interval, which can be eaten by the player to earn score.
* Eating food grows the player.
* Trains (moving obstacles) spawn at a set interval, and they traverse the play area until they are outside.
